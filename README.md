# spot-the-difference
AWS Game Builder Challenge Hackathon project

## Inspiration
Since childhood, I have always enjoyed spotting differences between pictures whenever I used to see them in newspapers, online games, etc. So, I really wanted to try building such a game by myself by leveraging the power of AI and various AWS services. I found this as an interesting way to also learn these new development skills while reminiscing about the game to make it a fun experience for all.

## What it does
Spotlight lets a player identify a certain number of differences between each image within the time limit, depending on their chosen level: easy, medium, or hard.

## How I built it
Amazon Q Developer: to generate 90% of the game code 
AWS Amplify Hosting: to deploy 
Amazon S3: to store game assets including images 
Amazon DynamoDB: to store game data including player scores and progress 
Amazon API Gateway: to handle requests 
AWS Lambda: to use serverless functions for backend processing

## Challenges I ran into
This was my first time learning about and working with AWS services and Amazon Q developer. Figuring out which AWS services would be appropriate to use for my features and understanding how to implement them was a bit of a challenge, yet a fun experience.
